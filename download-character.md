# How to Add Characters

Okay, so your SillyTavern is set up and ready to go. Now you need someone to talk to! In the world of SillyTavern, these are called **Character Cards**.

They're special `.png` image files that look like regular pictures but secretly contain all the data about a characterâ€”their personality, greeting, and everything else.

Hereâ€™s how to find and import them.

## Part 1: Find a Character You Like

There are two amazing websites where the community shares thousands of characters. You can spend hours just Browse!

* **[character-tavern.com](https'://character-tavern.com)** (Our sister site!) - A great, curated collection.
* **[chub.ai](https://chub.ai/)** - A massive, searchable archive of characters.

Go to either site and just look around until you find a character that seems interesting.

## Part 2: Download the Character Card

Once you've found the perfect character, you need to download their `.png` card file. The process is slightly different for each site.

#### On Character Tavern:

Look for the big **"Download Character Card"** button on the character's page and click it. This will save the `.png` file directly to your computer.

#### On Chub.ai:

On the character's page, you'll see a picture of the character. Simply **click on the "PNG" button** right below the image. That's the one you want!

!!!warning Watch Out!
Make sure you download the actual `.png` file. Don't just right-click and "Save Image As," as that can sometimes mess up the special data inside the file. Always use the site's official download button.
