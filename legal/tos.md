# Terms of Service

*Last Updated: 03/06/2025*

Welcome to Salenai! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Salenai's managed SillyTavern instance hosting services (the "Service") provided by Salenai ("Salenai," "we," "us," or "our").

By signing up for or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Account Registration and Responsibilities

### Eligibility
You must be of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the Service.

### Account Creation
To use the Service, you must register for an account by providing a valid email address, a username, and a password.

### Account Security
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Salenai account password and your individual SillyTavern instance credentials. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security by contacting [support@kyaralabs.com](mailto:support@kyaralabs.com).

### Instance Credentials Reset
If you lose your Salenai account password, you may use the provided password reset functionality. If you require a password reset for your specific SillyTavern instance, please contact [support@kyaralabs.com](mailto:support@kyaralabs.com).

### Account Sharing
Accounts are not to be shared between individuals.

## 2. The Service

### Service Description
Salenai provides managed hosting for SillyTavern instances. The Service is offered on an "unlimited" basis subject to a "Fair Use Policy" detailed below.

### Fair Use Policy
While we offer "unlimited" resources in principle, this is subject to fair use to ensure service stability and performance for all users. Prohibited activities under fair use include, but are not limited to, excessive consumption of server resources disproportionate to typical SillyTavern usage for AI roleplaying, or any use that degrades the service for other users. Salenai reserves the right to determine what constitutes a violation of this Fair Use Policy.

### AI Models and API Keys
The Service provides hosting for the SillyTavern interface ONLY. Users are solely responsible for providing and managing their own API keys (e.g., for OpenRouter or other AI services) and for any costs associated with such third-party services. Salenai does not provide AI models or API keys and is not responsible for the content generated by or the performance of any AI models accessed via the User's SillyTavern instance.

### Service Availability (Early Access)
The Service is currently offered in an Early Access phase. As such, Salenai does not offer any specific uptime guarantees. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Service operational, but acknowledge that interruptions and downtime may occur.

### Backups
Salenai will perform backups of user data within their SillyTavern instance (including configurations, chat logs, and characters created within SillyTavern) for a period of thirty (30) days. Users may request a restoration of their data from these backups by contacting [support@kyaralabs.com](mailto:support@kyaralabs.com). While Salenai endeavors to maintain reliable backups, we do not guarantee that backups will always be successful or that data can always be restored.

### Service Modifications
We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

## 3. Acceptable Use Policy

### Permitted Use
The Service is intended solely for hosting a SillyTavern instance for AI roleplaying and related activities.

### Prohibited Uses
You agree not to use the Service to:
- Engage in any illegal activities, including but not limited to the generation or distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), hate speech, or content that infringes on the rights of others.
- Conduct activities unrelated to the intended use of SillyTavern, such as cryptocurrency mining, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spamming, or hosting malicious software.
- Violate the terms of service of any third-party AI provider accessed through your SillyTavern instance (e.g., OpenRouter). You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for compliance with such third-party terms.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts.

### Content Responsibility
While Salenai permits a wide range of user-generated content within the SillyTavern instances, provided it is legal and complies with these Terms and the terms of any third-party AI provider, you are solely responsible for the content you create, store, or transmit using the Service.

### Violation Consequences
Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account without refund, at Salenai's sole discretion.

## 4. Fees, Payment, and Subscription

### Subscription Fee
The Service is offered on a subscription basis at the rate of $10 (USD) per month, payable via Stripe.

### Free Trial
New users are eligible for a seven (7) day free trial.

### Automatic Renewal
After the free trial period, your subscription will automatically renew each month unless cancelled. You authorize us to charge your payment method on file for the recurring monthly subscription fee.

### Cancellation
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting [support@kyaralabs.com](mailto:support@kyaralabs.com). Upon cancellation, your active SillyTavern instance data will be removed from our active servers. Backup data will be retained for thirty (30) days as per our backup policy before permanent deletion.

### Refund Policy
You may request a full refund within seven (7) days following the end of your initial 7-day free trial period (i.e., within the first 7 days of your first paid subscription period). After this period, fees are non-refundable except as required by law or at our sole discretion.

## 5. Intellectual Property

### User Content
You retain all ownership rights to the content (characters, chat logs, settings) you create and store within your SillyTavern instance ("User Content"). You grant Salenai a limited license to host, store, and display your User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of sharing it.

### Salenai's IP
The Salenai website, our branding, logos, and any custom software or code developed for the PaaS platform are the exclusive property of Salenai and its licensors. You may not use Salenai's IP without our prior written consent.

### SillyTavern Software

## 6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### Service Provided "AS IS"
The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

### No Liability for Third-Party Services
Salenai is not responsible for the functionality, reliability, or terms of service of any third-party services you may use in conjunction with your SillyTavern instance (e.g., OpenRouter or other AI model providers).

### Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Salenai, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (c) any content obtained from the Service; or (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

### Termination by Salenai

### Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## 8. Changes to Terms of Service

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
