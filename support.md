# Getting Support

Hey! We're here to help you get any issues sorted out quickly.

Salenai connects a few different services together (your hosting, the SillyTavern software, and the AI model provider). To get the fastest possible answer, it's important to ask the right team for the job.

Hereâ€™s a quick guide on who to contact.

---

### ðŸ¤” For questions about how SillyTavern works...

If you have a question about a feature **inside the SillyTavern software itself** â€” like how to format character cards, use specific extensions, or a UI setting isn't working as you expect â€” the absolute experts are in the official SillyTavern community.

> **Go to the official SillyTavern Discord:** [https://discord.gg/sillytavern](https://discord.gg/sillytavern)

---

### ðŸš€ For problems with your Salenai hosting...

If your issue is **specifically with our service** â€” like your instance seems slow, a backup failed, your custom domain isn't working, or you have a billing question â€” we are the ones to ask! This is what your subscription covers.

> **Contact us directly at:** [support@kyaralabs.com](mailto:support@kyaralabs.com)

---

### ðŸ¤– For issues with AI generations (via OpenRouter)...

If the **AI itself is giving you weird responses**, providing error messages when you try to generate, or you have questions about a specific model on OpenRouter, their team and community are the best place to get help.
