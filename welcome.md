# Hey! Welcome to the Salenai Docs.

So, you're here. Awesome. This is where you'll find all the guides and answers you need for Salenai. We keep things simple here, just like with our service.

### So, Why Does Salenai Even Exist?

Let's be real: setting up SillyTavern can be a total headache.

You wanted to chat with your favorite AI, but instead you got stuck in a nightmare of `git pull`, `npm install`, fighting with Docker, and trying to figure out how to keep it all updated and secure.

**Salenai is the "skip" button for all of that.**

We handle all the boring, technical stuff so you can stop wasting time on setup and start doing what you actually wanted to do: have fun. That's it. That's the whole idea.
